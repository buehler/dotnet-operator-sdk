# Development and Operator Utilities

## Serialization Helper

When working with custom entities, you may need to serialize or deserialize them to and from JSON, especially when interacting with the Kubernetes API or for testing purposes. `KubeOps` provides a helper class, `KubernetesJsonSerializer`, to make this process straightforward and consistent with Kubernetes conventions.

### Example Usage

#### Get the Kubernetes specific JsonSerializerOptions

```csharp
var options = KubernetesJsonSerializer.SerializerOptions;
```

#### Serialize an Entity

```csharp
var entity = new V1DemoEntity { /* ... initialize ... */ };
string json = KubernetesJsonSerializer.Serialize(entity);
```

#### Deserialize an Entity

```csharp
string json = /* JSON string from Kubernetes */;
var entity = KubernetesJsonSerializer.Deserialize<V1DemoEntity>(json);
```

#### With Custom JsonSerializerOptions

```csharp
var options = new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true };
string json = KubernetesJsonSerializer.Serialize(entity, options);
```

### API Overview

- `Serialize(object value, JsonSerializerOptions? options = null)`: Serializes an object to a JSON string.
- `Deserialize<T>(...)`: Deserializes JSON (from string, stream, `JsonDocument`, `JsonElement`, or `JsonNode`) to a strongly-typed object.

This helper ensures your custom entities are always serialized and deserialized in a way that's compatible with Kubernetes expectations.

## CRD Installer Utility

:::warning Destructive Utility
The CRD Installer is a powerful utility intended **only for development environments**. Depending on its settings, it can overwrite or delete existing CRDs, which may lead to data loss or cluster instability. **Never use this in production!**
:::

When developing operators, you may want to quickly install or update CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) in your cluster. The `CrdInstaller` service automates this process, making it easier to iterate on CRD changes during development.

### How to Add the CRD Installer

To enable the CRD installer, add the following to your operator's `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddKubernetesOperator()
#if DEBUG
    .AddCrdInstaller(c =>
    {
        c.OverwriteExisting = true;
        c.DeleteOnShutdown = true;
    })
#endif
    .RegisterComponents();
```

- `OverwriteExisting`: If `true`, existing CRDs with the same name will be **overwritten**. This is useful for development but can be destructive if used in production, as it may cause data loss.
- `DeleteOnShutdown`: If `true`, all CRDs installed by the operator will be **deleted** when the operator shuts down. This is extremely destructive and should only be used in disposable development environments.
