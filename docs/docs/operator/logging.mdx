# Logging, Tracing, and OpenTelemetry

## Logging with `ILogger` and Scopes

This project uses Microsoft's [`ILogger`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging) interface for logging. It provides a standardized and extensible way to capture events within the application.

Using _scopes_ enables hierarchical organization of log messages and allows contextual information to be attached to each entry.

### ILogger Basics

The `ILogger` interface is part of [`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging) and provides methods to log messages at various severity levels (e.g., `Information`, `Warning`, `Error`).

Logging can be enabled using either `WebApplication.CreateBuilder`, `Host.CreateDefaultBuilder`, or the `AddLogging` extension method on the `IServiceCollection`.

You can log from your code by injecting `ILogger<MyEntityController>` (or a similar type) into your component.

### Using Scopes

Scopes define a logical boundary in which all log entries are automatically enriched with contextual metadata. This is especially useful for correlating logs related to a specific request or operation.

By default, the [ResourceWatcher](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-operator-sdk/blob/main/src/KubeOps.Operator/Watcher/ResourceWatcher%7BTEntity%7D.cs) starts a new scope for every watch event it processes. Each scope includes:

- `EventType`: Type of the received watch event (`Added`, `Modified`, `Deleted`, `Error`, `Bookmark`)
- `Kind`: Custom Resource Definition (CRD) kind
- `Namespace`: CRD namespace
- `Name`: CRD name
- `ResourceVersion`: CRD resource version

You can create additional scopes in your code using `logger.BeginScope(state)`, where `state` can be either a string or a custom object.

To include scopes in the logging output, they must be explicitly enabled either via configuration or code:

**`appsettings.json`:**

```json
"Logging": {
  "Console": {
    "FormatterName": "Simple",
    "FormatterOptions": {
      "IncludeScopes": true
    }
  },
  "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "KubeOps": "Trace"
  }
}
```

**Programmatic configuration:**

```csharp
builder
    .ConfigureLogging((hostBuilderContext, loggingBuilder) =>
    {
        loggingBuilder
            .AddSimpleConsole(options => options.IncludeScopes = true);
    });
```

:::tip
To enable scopes with OpenTelemetry, configure it as follows:

```json
"OpenTelemetry": {
  "IncludeScopes": true,
  "ParseStateValues": true,
  "IncludeFormattedMessage": true
}
```

The scope state must be an `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object?>` to ensure correct serialization and inclusion in log entries.

## Tracing with `System.Diagnostics` and `ActivitySource`

For [distributed tracing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/distributed-tracing-concepts), this project uses `System.Diagnostics` in combination with `ActivitySource`.
Activities can be started using `ActivitySource.StartActivity`.

The operator registers an `ActivitySource` instance with the operator name in the dependency injection (DI) container. To use a custom `ActivitySource`, simply register your own, the DI will provide the last registered instance when requested.

:::tip
You can configure the operator name (and thus the `ActivitySource` name) via `OperatorSettings`:

```csharp
const string OperatorName = "my-operator";

builder
    .Services
    .AddKubernetesOperator(settings => settings.Name = OperatorName);
```

If you're using OpenTelemetry, tracing must be explicitly configured in code. Make sure to add the same source name used when creating the `ActivitySource`.

Also, create a `ResourceBuilder` to name your service properly in trace output:

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddOpenTelemetry()
    .WithTracing(tracerProviderBuilder =>
        tracerProviderBuilder
            .SetResourceBuilder(
                ResourceBuilder.CreateDefault()
                    .AddService(serviceName: OperatorName, serviceVersion: "1.0.0"))
            .AddSource(OperatorName));
```

## OpenTelemetry Configuration for Azure Logging

To use OpenTelemetry with Azure, it is recommended to adopt the [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-enable).
You can enable it via code:

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddOpenTelemetry()
    .UseAzureMonitor();
```

### Full Example Configuration in `Program.cs` (or `Startup.cs`)

A complete setup with logging, tracing, and OpenTelemetry might look like this:

**`appsettings.json`:**

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "KubeOps": "Trace"
    },
    "Console": {
      "FormatterName": "Simple",
      "FormatterOptions": {
        "IncludeScopes": true,
        "SingleLine": true
      }
    },
    "OpenTelemetry": {
      "IncludeScopes": true,
      "ParseStateValues": true,
      "IncludeFormattedMessage": true
    }
  }
}
```

**`Program.cs`:**

```csharp
const string OperatorName = "my-platform-operator";

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder
    .Services
    .AddKubernetesOperator(settings => settings.Name = OperatorName)
    .RegisterComponents();

builder
    .Services
    .AddOpenTelemetry()
    .WithTracing(tracerProviderBuilder =>
        tracerProviderBuilder
            .SetResourceBuilder(
                ResourceBuilder.CreateDefault()
                    .AddService(serviceName: OperatorName, serviceVersion: "1.0.0"))
            .AddSource(OperatorName))
    .UseAzureMonitor();
```
