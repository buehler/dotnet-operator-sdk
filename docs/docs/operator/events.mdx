# Events

Events in Kubernetes are objects that provide insight into what's happening inside a cluster. They are represented by the `Corev1Event` resource and are used to track important state changes, errors, and other information about resources.

## Understanding Kubernetes Events

Events in Kubernetes are:

- Namespaced resources
- Automatically cleaned up after a certain time
- Used to track state changes and errors
- Visible through `kubectl describe` and `kubectl get events`

### Event Structure

A Kubernetes event contains:

- **Type**: Either `Normal` or `Warning`
- **Reason**: A short, machine-readable string
- **Message**: A human-readable description
- **Count**: Number of times this event has occurred
- **FirstTimestamp**: When the event first occurred
- **LastTimestamp**: When the event last occurred
- **InvolvedObject**: The object the event is about

## Common Event Examples

Here are some typical events you might see for a Deployment:

```yaml
# Successful pod creation
Type:    Normal
Reason:  Scheduled
Message: Successfully assigned default/my-deployment-5d89d9d6b8-abc12 to node-1

# Image pull success
Type:    Normal
Reason:  Pulled
Message: Successfully pulled image "myapp:1.0.0"

# Image pull failure
Type:    Warning
Reason:  Failed
Message: Failed to pull image "myapp:1.0.0": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: pull access denied for myapp, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'

# Pod startup
Type:    Normal
Reason:  Started
Message: Started container myapp
```

## Publishing Events in KubeOps

KubeOps provides an `EventPublisher` to create and update events for your custom resources. The publisher is available through dependency injection in your controllers.

### Basic Usage

```csharp
public class DemoController(EventPublisher eventPublisher) : IEntityController<V1DemoEntity>
{
    public async Task ReconcileAsync(V1DemoEntity entity, CancellationToken token)
    {
        try
        {
            // Your reconciliation logic here
            await eventPublisher(
                entity,
                "Reconciled",
                "Entity was successfully reconciled",
                EventType.Normal,
                token);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            await eventPublisher(
                entity,
                "ReconcileFailed",
                $"Failed to reconcile entity: {ex.Message}",
                EventType.Warning,
                token);
        }
    }
}
```

### Event Types

KubeOps provides two event types:

- `EventType.Normal`: For informational events
- `EventType.Warning`: For error conditions or issues

### Best Practices

1. **Event Naming**:

   - Use consistent, machine-readable reasons
   - Make messages human-readable and descriptive
   - Include relevant details in the message

2. **Event Frequency**:

   - Don't create too many events
   - Use the count field to track repeated events
   - Focus on important state changes

3. **Event Content**:
   - Include relevant error messages
   - Add context about the operation
   - Reference related resources

### Example Scenarios

1. **Resource Creation**:

```csharp
await eventPublisher(
    entity,
    "Created",
    $"Created new {entity.Kind} {entity.Metadata.Name}",
    EventType.Normal,
    token);
```

2. **Validation Failure**:

```csharp
await eventPublisher(
    entity,
    "ValidationFailed",
    $"Invalid configuration: {validationError}",
    EventType.Warning,
    token);
```

3. **External Service Error**:

```csharp
await eventPublisher(
    entity,
    "ExternalServiceError",
    $"Failed to connect to external service: {error.Message}",
    EventType.Warning,
    token);
```

## Viewing Events

You can view events in several ways:

1. **Using kubectl**:

```bash
# List all events in a namespace
kubectl get events

# Describe a specific resource to see its events
kubectl describe demo-entity my-entity
```

2. **Using the Kubernetes Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to the Events section
   - Filter by namespace and resource type

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Too Many Events**:

   - Creating events for every small change
   - Not using the count field for repeated events
   - Creating events that don't provide value

2. **Poor Event Quality**:

   - Unclear or inconsistent messages
   - Missing important context
   - Not distinguishing between normal and warning events

3. **Event Timing**:
   - Creating events too early in the process
   - Not updating events when conditions change
   - Missing important state transitions
