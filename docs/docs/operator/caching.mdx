## ResourceWatcher

The `ResourceWatcher` uses an instance of `IFusionCache` to store the `.metadata.generation` value of each observed resource. The key for the cache entry is the resource's unique ID (`metadata.uid`).
The primary purpose of the cache is to skip reconciliation cycles for events that do not represent an actual change to a resource's specification (`.spec`).

1. **`MODIFIED` Event Type**:
    - Kubernetes only increments the `.metadata.generation` value of a resource when its specification (`.spec`) changes. Updates to status fields (`.status`), while also triggering a `MODIFIED` event, do not increase the `generation`.
    - When a `MODIFIED` event arrives, the `ResourceWatcher` compares the `generation` of the incoming resource with the value stored in `FusionCache`.
    - If the new `generation` is not greater than the cached one, the reconciliation is skipped. This is a critical optimization, as status updates can occur very frequently (e.g., from other controllers) and typically do not require action from your operator.
    - Only when the `generation` has increased is the resource forwarded for reconciliation, and the new `generation` value is stored in the cache.

2. **`ADDED` Event Type**:
    - On an `ADDED` event, the watcher checks if the resource is already present in the cache.
    - This prevents resources that the operator already knows about (e.g., after a watcher restart) from being incorrectly treated as "new" and reconciled again.

3. **`DELETED` Event Type**:
    - When a resource is deleted, the watcher removes the corresponding entry from the cache to keep the memory clean.

### Default Configuration: In-Memory (L1) Cache

By default, and without any extra configuration, `KubeOps` uses a simple in-memory cache for `FusionCache`.

- **Advantages**:
    - Requires zero configuration.
    - Very fast, as all data is held in the operator pod's memory.

- **Disadvantages**:
    - The cache is volatile. If the pod restarts, all stored `generation` values are lost, leading to a full reconciliation of all observed resources.

### Advanced Configuration: Distributed (L2) Cache

For robust use in production or HA environments, it is essential to extend `FusionCache` with a distributed L2 cache and a backplane. This ensures that all operator instances share a consistent state.
A common setup for this involves using **Redis**.

**Steps to Configure a Distributed Cache with Redis:**

1. **Add the necessary NuGet packages to your project:**
    - `ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache.Serialization.SystemTextJson` (or another serializer)
    - `ZiggyCreatures.FusionCache.Backplane.StackExchangeRedis`
    - `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis`

2. **Configure the services in your `Program.cs`:**
You need to configure `FusionCache` with a serializer, the distributed cache (L2), and a backplane. The backplane (e.g., via Redis Pub/Sub) ensures that cache invalidations (like a `SET` or `REMOVE`) are immediately propagated to all other operator pods, keeping their L1 caches in sync.
