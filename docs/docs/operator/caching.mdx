## ResourceWatcher

The `ResourceWatcher` uses a cache instance to store the `.metadata.generation` value of each observed resource.
The key for the cache entry is the resource's unique ID (`metadata.uid`).

The primary purpose of the cache is to skip reconciliation cycles for events that do not represent an actual change to a resource's specification (`.spec`).

1. **`MODIFIED` Event Type**:
    - Kubernetes only increments the `.metadata.generation` value of a resource when its specification (`.spec`) changes.
      Updates to status fields (`.status`), while also triggering a `MODIFIED` event, do not increase the `generation`.
    - When a `MODIFIED` event arrives, the `ResourceWatcher` compares the `generation` of the incoming resource with the value stored in the cache.
    - If the new `generation` is not greater than the cached one, the reconciliation is skipped.
      This is a critical optimization, as status updates can occur very frequently (e.g., from other controllers) and typically do not require action from your operator.
    - Only when the `generation` has increased is the resource forwarded for reconciliation, and the new `generation` value is stored in the cache.

2. **`ADDED` Event Type**:
    - On an `ADDED` event, the watcher checks if the resource is already present in the cache.
    - This prevents resources that the operator already knows about (e.g., after a watcher restart) from being incorrectly treated as "new" and reconciled again.

3. **`DELETED` Event Type**:
    - When a resource is deleted, the watcher removes the corresponding entry from the cache to keep the memory clean.

### Default Configuration: In-Memory (L1) Cache

By default, and without any extra configuration, `KubeOps` uses a simple in-memory cache.

- **Advantages**:
    - Requires zero configuration.
    - Very fast, as all data is held in the operator pod's memory.

- **Disadvantages**:
    - The cache is volatile. If the pod restarts, all stored `generation` values are lost, leading to a full reconciliation of all observed resources.

### Advanced Configuration: Distributed (L2) Cache

For robust use in production or HA environments, it could be essential to extend cache with a distributed L2 cache and a backplane.
This ensures that all operator instances share a consistent state.
A common setup for this involves using [**Redis**](https://github.com/redis/redis).

### FusionCache

KubeOps utilizes [`FusionCache`](https://github.com/ZiggyCreatures/FusionCache/blob/main/docs/AGentleIntroduction.md) for seamless support of an L1/L2 cache.
Via `OperatorSettings.ConfigureResourceWatcherEntityCache`, an `Action` is provided that allows extending the standard configuration or
overwriting it with a customized version.

Here is an example of what a customized configuration with an L2 cache could look like:

```csharp
builder
    .Services
    .AddKubernetesOperator(settings =>
    {
        settings.Name = OperatorName;
        settings.ConfigureResourceWatcherEntityCache =
            cacheBuilder =>
                cacheBuilder
                    .WithCacheKeyPrefix($"{CacheConstants.CacheNames.ResourceWatcher}:")
                    .WithSerializer(_ => new FusionCacheSystemTextJsonSerializer())
                    .WithRegisteredDistributedCache()
                    .WithDefaultEntryOptions(options =>
                        options.Duration = TimeSpan.MaxValue);
    })
```
