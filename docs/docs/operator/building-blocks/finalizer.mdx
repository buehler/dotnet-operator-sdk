# Finalizers

Finalizers are a crucial mechanism in Kubernetes for ensuring proper cleanup of resources. They provide a way to guarantee that cleanup operations are completed before a resource is actually deleted from the cluster.

## What are Finalizers?

Finalizers are markers on resources that prevent their deletion until certain conditions are met. They are used to:

- Ensure proper cleanup of dependent resources
- Prevent accidental deletion of critical resources
- Guarantee that cleanup operations are completed successfully

## How Kubernetes Handles Finalizers

When a resource is marked for deletion:

1. Kubernetes adds a `deletionTimestamp` to the resource
2. The resource remains in the cluster until all finalizers are removed
3. Each finalizer must explicitly remove itself after completing its cleanup
4. Only when all finalizers are removed is the resource actually deleted

This mechanism ensures that cleanup operations are:

- Guaranteed to run
- Run in a controlled manner
- Completed before resource deletion

## Implementing Finalizers

To implement a finalizer, create a class that implements `IEntityFinalizer<TEntity>`:

```csharp
public class DemoEntityFinalizer(
    ILogger<DemoEntityFinalizer> logger,
    IKubernetesClient client) : IEntityFinalizer<V1DemoEntity>
{
    public async Task FinalizeAsync(V1DemoEntity entity, CancellationToken token)
    {
        logger.LogInformation("Finalizing entity {Entity}", entity);

        try
        {
            // Clean up resources
            await CleanupResources(entity);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            logger.LogError(ex, "Error finalizing entity {Entity}", entity);
            throw; // Re-throw to prevent finalizer removal
        }
    }
}
```

## Using Finalizers

Finalizers are automatically attached to entities using the `EntityFinalizerAttacher` delegate. This delegate is injected into your controller and handles the finalizer attachment:

```csharp
[EntityRbac(typeof(V1DemoEntity), Verbs = RbacVerb.All)]
public class V1DemoEntityController(
    ILogger<V1DemoEntityController> logger,
    EntityFinalizerAttacher<DemoEntityFinalizer, V1DemoEntity> finalizer)
    : IEntityController<V1DemoEntity>
{
    public async Task ReconcileAsync(V1DemoEntity entity, CancellationToken token)
    {
        // Attach the finalizer to the entity
        entity = await finalizer(entity, token);

        // Continue with reconciliation logic
        logger.LogInformation("Reconciling entity {Entity}", entity);
    }

    public async Task DeletedAsync(V1DemoEntity entity, CancellationToken token)
    {
        logger.LogInformation("Entity {Entity} was deleted", entity);
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Idempotency

- Make finalizer logic idempotent
- Handle cases where resources are already deleted
- Check resource existence before attempting cleanup

```csharp
public async Task FinalizeAsync(V1DemoEntity entity, CancellationToken token)
{
    // Check if resources still exist before cleanup
    var resources = await GetResources(entity);
    if (!resources.Any())
    {
        // Resources already cleaned up
        return;
    }

    // Perform cleanup
    await CleanupResources(resources);
}
```

### 2. Error Handling

- Handle errors gracefully
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Consider implementing retry logic for transient failures

```csharp
public async Task FinalizeAsync(V1DemoEntity entity, CancellationToken token)
{
    try
    {
        await FinalizeInternal(entity, token);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        logger.LogError(ex, "Error finalizing entity {Entity}", entity);
        // Re-throw to prevent finalizer removal
        throw;
    }
}
```

### 3. Resource Management

- Clean up all resources created by the entity
- Handle dependencies between resources
- Consider cleanup order (e.g., delete pods before services)

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Stuck Resources

If a finalizer fails to complete:

- The resource will remain in the cluster
- It will be marked for deletion but never actually deleted
- Manual intervention may be required

To fix stuck resources:

1. Identify the failing finalizer
2. Fix the underlying issue
3. Manually remove the finalizer only if necessary:
   ```bash
   kubectl patch <resource> <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
   ```

:::warning Manual Finalizer Removal
Only remove finalizers manually as a last resort. This can lead to orphaned resources and inconsistent cluster state.
:::

### 2. Race Conditions

- Multiple finalizers running concurrently
- Resources being deleted by other controllers
- Network issues during cleanup

Solution: Implement proper error handling and retry logic.

### 3. Infinite Loops

- Finalizer logic that never completes
- Resources that can't be deleted
- External dependencies that are unavailable

Solution: Implement timeouts and fallback mechanisms.

## When to Use Finalizers

Use finalizers when:

- Resources need guaranteed cleanup
- External systems need to be notified of deletion
- Dependencies need to be cleaned up in a specific order
- Resource deletion needs to be atomic

Don't use finalizers for:

- Simple logging or monitoring
- Non-critical cleanup tasks
- Operations that can be handled by the `DeletedAsync` method in controllers
