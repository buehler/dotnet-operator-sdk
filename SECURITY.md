# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

By default, the latest major version of the project is supported. Information about supported versions and their security update status will be documented here as the project matures and establishes a formal release cadence.

| < Latest Major | :x:                |

## Dependency Updates

We use [Renovate Bot](https://renovatebot.com) to automatically update all dependencies to the newest versions. This ensures that our project remains secure by incorporating the latest security patches. Renovate Bot only merges updates when all checks pass successfully.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The KubeOps team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
