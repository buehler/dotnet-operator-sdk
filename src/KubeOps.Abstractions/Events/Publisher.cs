/// This injectable delegate publishes events on entities. Events are created in the same
/// namespace as the provided entity. However, if no namespace is provided (for example in
/// cluster wide entities), the "default" namespace is used.
///
/// The delegate creates a <see cref="Corev1Event"/> if none does exist or updates the
/// count and last seen timestamp if the same event already fired.
///
/// Events have a hex encoded name of a SHA512 hash. For the delegate to update
/// an event, the entity, reason, message, and type must be the same.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="entity">The entity that is involved with the event.</param>
/// <param name="reason">The reason string. This should be a machine readable reason string.</param>
/// <param name="message">A human readable string for the event.</param>
/// <param name="type">The <see cref="EventType"/> of the event (either normal or warning).</param>
/// <returns>A task that finishes when the event is created or updated.</returns>
/// <example>
/// Controller that fires a simple reconcile event on any entity it encounters.
/// Note that the publication of an event does not trigger another reconcile.
