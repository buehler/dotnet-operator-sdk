# KubeOps - Kubernetes Operators in .NET

**Build Kubernetes Operators in .NET with Ease**

[![.NET Release](https://github.com/buehler/dotnet-operator-sdk/actions/workflows/dotnet-release.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/buehler/dotnet-operator-sdk/actions/workflows/dotnet-release.yml)
[![Scheduled Code Security Testing](https://github.com/buehler/dotnet-operator-sdk/actions/workflows/security-analysis.yml/badge.svg?event=schedule)](https://github.com/buehler/dotnet-operator-sdk/actions/workflows/security-analysis.yml)

**KubeOps** is a [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) SDK designed for [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) developers. It allows you to leverage your C# skills and the rich .NET ecosystem to build powerful Kubernetes controllers that automate the management of complex applications. KubeOps simplifies operator development by providing high-level abstractions, code generators, and helper utilities.

**For comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and API references, please visit the official [KubeOps Documentation Site](https://buehler.github.io/dotnet-operator-sdk/).**

The documentation is also provided within the code itself (description of methods and classes), and each package contains a README with further information.

## Key Features

- **Define CRDs in C#:** Model your [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/) using plain C# classes and attributes.
- **Controller Logic:** Implement reconciliation logic using the `IEntityController<TEntity>` interface.
- **Finalizers:** Easily add cleanup logic before resource deletion with `IEntityFinalizer<TEntity>`.
- **Webhooks:** Create [Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) (validating/mutating) and [Conversion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/#webhook-conversion) webhooks integrated with ASP.NET Core.
- **Code Generation:** Includes Roslyn source generators and a CLI tool (`dotnet kubeops`) to automate boilerplate code for CRDs, controllers, and RBAC rules.
- **Enhanced Kubernetes Client:** Provides convenience methods built on top of the official client library.
- **Leader Election:** Automatic handling for high-availability operator deployments.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to start building an operator with KubeOps:

1.  **Using the normal dotnet console template:**

    ```bash
    # Create a new console project
    dotnet new console -n MyOperator
    cd MyOperator

    # Add the KubeOps.Operator package
    dotnet add package KubeOps.Operator
    ```

2.  **Using the project templates:**

    ```bash
    # Install the templates
    dotnet new install KubeOps.Templates

    # Create a new operator project
    dotnet new operator -n MyOperator
    cd MyOperator
    ```

Both methods generate a basic operator structure with a sample custom resource, controller, and finalizer. The template approach is simpler and more direct, while the CLI provides additional commands for generating CRDs, RBAC rules, and more.

## Packages

All packages target [.NET 8.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8/overview) and [.NET 9.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview), leveraging modern C# features. The underlying Kubernetes client library (`KubernetesClient.Official`) also follows this versioning strategy.

The SDK is designed to be modular. You can include only the packages you need:

| Package                                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Motivation

KubeOps aims to provide a first-class experience for developing Kubernetes operators within the .NET ecosystem, offering an alternative to Go-based SDKs like Kubebuilder and Operator SDK, while embracing familiar C# patterns and tooling.

**Why choose KubeOps?**

- **Leverage your .NET Skills:** Build operators using C#, a language you already know, with access to the extensive .NET Base Class Library and NuGet ecosystem.
- **Strong Typing & IDE Support:** Benefit from compile-time checks and rich IDE features like IntelliSense and debugging.
- **Simplified Abstractions:** Focus on your reconciliation logic, not Kubernetes API boilerplate.
- **Code Generation:** Reduce manual effort with generators for CRDs, RBAC, and controller/webhook registrations.
