This is the repository of the dotnet kubernetes operator sdk.

Please head over to [the documentation on github pages](https://buehler.github.io/dotnet-operator-sdk/)
for further reading. The API and other elements (as well as a getting started) are documented there.

If you want to contribute, feel free to open a pull request :-)

The motivation was to learn more about the quirks of kubernetes itself and
provide an alternative to kubebuilder and operator sdk which are both
written in GoLang.
